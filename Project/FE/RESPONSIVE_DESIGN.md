# Responsive Design Implementation

## Overview
BandhanConnect has been completely redesigned with a mobile-first approach to ensure perfect functionality across all devices:
- **Mobile (320px+)**: Primary focus with touch-friendly interfaces
- **Tablet (768px+)**: Optimized layouts for medium screens
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Full-featured experience

## Breakpoint System

### Custom Tailwind Breakpoints
```javascript
screens: {
  'xs': '320px',    // Small mobile
  'sm': '640px',    // Large mobile
  'md': '768px',    // Tablet
  'lg': '1024px',   // Desktop
  'xl': '1280px',   // Large desktop
  '2xl': '1536px',  // Extra large
}
```

## Mobile-First Design Principles

### 1. Typography Scaling
- **Mobile (320px)**: Smaller, readable fonts
- **Tablet (768px)**: Medium-sized fonts
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Larger, comfortable fonts

```css
h1 { @apply text-2xl xs:text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl; }
h2 { @apply text-xl xs:text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl; }
p { @apply text-sm xs:text-base sm:text-lg; }
```

### 2. Spacing & Layout
- **Mobile**: Compact spacing for efficiency
- **Tablet**: Balanced spacing
- **Desktop**: Generous spacing for comfort

```css
.container-responsive { @apply px-3 xs:px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8; }
.section-responsive { @apply py-4 xs:py-6 sm:py-8 md:py-12; }
```

### 3. Grid Systems
- **Mobile**: Single column layouts
- **Tablet**: 2-3 column grids
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layouts

```css
.grid-responsive { @apply grid-cols-1 xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4; }
```
